## Purpose
I created this project as part of my final physics project in my senior year of high school. I wanted to create something that would be a blend of physics, programming and electronics. After some research, I decided to create a motion detecting object avoiding robot car.
The car is programmed in such a way that it scans objects in its surroundings and avoids them, thus whenever it detects a wall or an object, it is programmed to turn and continue to move in another direction. 


## Project Overview
- The project is a motion detecting object avoiding robot car.
- The programming language used is C/C++.
- The car has been programmed using an Arduino Uno which was connected to a stepper motor.
- The framework consists of two motors, two tyres, single ball bearing and two C cells and one D cell.
- To sense the surroundings an ultrasonic sensor was programmed using the Arduino which was attached to a servo motor.
